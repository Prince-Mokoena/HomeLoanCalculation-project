# HomeLoanCalculation-project
The HomeLoanCalculation program is a Java-based application that allows users to estimate their monthly home loan payments and determine whether they qualify for a loan based on credit score and deposit percentage.

It uses mathematical calculations to compute monthly repayments according to the loan amount, interest rate, and a randomly generated loan period. The program also includes a qualification check using credit score and deposit requirements.
